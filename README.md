### ‚ú® Features

*   **AI-Assisted Prompt Engineering:** Don't know what to write? Select a high-level style (e.g., "Fashion," "Business") and a city, and Nina's "Editorial" assistant will generate a set of creative, detailed prompts for you.
*   **Advanced Image Generation:** Generate 1-4 images at a time using Google's Imagen models, with controls for aspect ratio and model selection.
*   **AI-Powered Critique:** After generating images, receive an "Editor's Notes" critique from an AI persona that analyzes your images based on prompt alignment, photorealism, and aesthetic qualities.
*   **Dynamic Viewing Experience:** View your creations in multiple layouts, including a standard grid and two "quilted" staggered layouts for a more editorial feel.
*   **Secure, Shareable, and Persistent:** The application is secured with a server-side authorization service, deployed to Firebase Hosting for easy sharing, and saves all your creations to a personal gallery backed by Firestore.
