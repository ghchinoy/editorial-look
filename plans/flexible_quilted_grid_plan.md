# Plan: Flexible Quilted Grid

This plan outlines the implementation of new features to make the quilted grid more flexible and interactive.

### Preliminary Thoughts on Plan 2: Flexible Quilted Grid

*   **Full-Screen Image View:**
    *   This can be achieved using a `Dialog` or a new route that displays the image in a `PhotoView` or similar widget that supports zooming and panning.
    *   When an image in the grid is tapped, we will open the full-screen view.

*   **Rotate Image Order:**
    *   This will require managing the order of the images in the state.
    *   A button will be added to the UI (perhaps an icon button on the grid itself).
    *   When the button is tapped, we will update the state with the new image order, and the UI will rebuild to reflect the change.
    *   We will need to be careful about how we manage the state to ensure that the rotation is smooth and doesn't cause any unexpected behavior.


### Part 1: Full-Screen Image View

*   **Task 1.1: Choose an Implementation.**
    *   [ ] Research and decide between a simple `Dialog` with `Image.network` or a more advanced package like `photo_view` for pinch-to-zoom capabilities.

*   **Task 1.2: Implement Full-Screen View.**
    *   [ ] Wrap the `StackedImagePreview` widget in a `GestureDetector` to handle tap events.
    *   [ ] On tap, open a dialog or a new route to display the selected image in full screen.
    *   [ ] Add a close button to the full-screen view.

### Part 2: Image Rotation

*   **Task 2.1: Add Rotation Button.**
    *   [ ] Add an `IconButton` to the UI. The location of the button is to be determined.

*   **Task 2.2: Implement Rotation Logic.**
    *   [ ] In `HomeScreenState`, create a method to handle the rotation of the `_generatedImages` list.
    *   [ ] This method will reorder the list of images (e.g., move the first image to the end).

*   **Task 2.3: Update the UI.**
    *   [ ] When the rotation button is tapped, call the rotation method and use `setState` to rebuild the `ImageGrid` with the new image order.

### Part 3: UI/UX Refinements

*   **Task 3.1: (Optional) Add Animation.**
    *   [ ] Consider adding a subtle animation to the image rotation to make the transition smoother.

### Questions for Approval

1.  For the full-screen view, would you prefer a simple dialog or a more advanced view with pinch-to-zoom capabilities?
2.  Where would you like the rotation button to be placed? On each image, or as a general button for the entire grid?
